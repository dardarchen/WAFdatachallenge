Data Processing Steps:
-removed any NaN values from numerical columns
-removed any null values from text columns
-converted longitude and latitude into one coordinate for plotting purposes
-made everything numerical (text fields turned into 1 if the listing had it and 0 if not, booleans turned to 0
and 1, etc)

Quirks:
-lots of entries were missing reviews of any kind - no guests yet?

Outliers:
-prices above 1000 daily, some as high as 25000
-ratings under 3.5, very very few are as low as 1 or 2. large majority between 4 and 5
-the host not having a profile pic, out of a sample of around 17500 entires, only 50 didn't have profile pics
-having response rates lower than 0.8
